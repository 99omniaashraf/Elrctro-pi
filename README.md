## The DataPrepKit capstone project is a comprehensive toolkit for preprocessing datasets, focusing on efficient data reading, summary generation, handling missing values, and categorical data encoding. The key features and requirements outlined provide a clear roadmap for students to follow, ensuring a robust and versatile Python package. Let's break down the key aspects:

# Key Features:
==============

    1- Data Reading:
    Implement functions for reading data from CSV, Excel, and JSON files using Pandas.
    Ensure compatibility and flexibility in handling different file formats.
    ----------------

    2- Data Summary:
    Develop functions to generate key statistical summaries using NumPy and Pandas.
    Include metrics like average and most frequent values for a comprehensive overview.
    ----------------------------

    3- Handling Missing Values:
    Create functions to handle missing values with predefined strategies (removal or imputation).
    Ensure flexibility in strategy selection based on user preferences.
    ------------------------------

    4- Categorical Data Encoding:
    Implement encoding functions to convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
    Consider different encoding methods to accommodate various use cases.
    -----------------------

    5- Package Deployment:
    Publish the DataPrepKit package on PyPI for easy accessibility within the Python community.
    Ensure proper documentation and versioning for user clarity.
